#Stage 2: Code your own quiz

#the following strings are taken from the fill_in_the_blanks.py exercise
#will use these strings in my quiz

#easy string - 4 blanks
easy = "A common first thing to do in a language is display
'Hello __1__!'  In __2__ this is particularly easy; all you have to do
is type in:
__3__ "Hello __1__!"
Of course, that isn't a very useful thing to do. However, it is an
example of how to output to the user using the __3__ command, and
produces a program which does something, so it is useful in that capacity.

It may seem a bit odd to do something in a Turing complete language that
can be done even more easily with an __4__ file in a browser, but it's
a step in learning __2__ syntax, and that's really its purpose."

easy_answers = ['world', 'Python', 'print', 'HTML']

#medium string - 4 blanks
medium = "A __1__ is created with the def keyword.  You specify the inputs a
__1__ takes by adding __2__ separated by commas between the parentheses.
__1__s by default returns __3__ if you don't specify the value to retrun.
__2__ can be standard data types such as string, integer, dictionary, tuple,
and __4__ or can be more complicated such as objects and lambda functions." 

medium_answers = ['function', 'arguments', 'None', 'list'] 

#hard string - 4 blanks
hard_level = "When you create a __1__, certain __2__s are automatically
generated for you if you don't make them manually. These contain multiple
underscores before and after the word defining them.  When you write
a __1__, you almost always include at least the __3__ __2__, defining
variables for when __4__s of the __1__ get made.  Additionally, you generally
want to create a __5__ __2__, which will allow a string representation
of the method to be viewed by other developers.

You can also create binary operators, like __6__ and __7__, which
allow + and - to be used by __4__s of the __1__.  Similarly, __8__,
__9__, and __10__ allow __4__s of the __1__ to be compared
(with <, >, and ==)." 

hard_answers = ['class', 'method', '__init__', 'instance', '__repr__', '__add__', '__sub__', '__lt__', '__gt__', '__eq__']

#sample string is from the file Udacity wants us to start from 
#so I will use it to start my quiz script
sample = '''A ___1___ is created with the def keyword. You specify the inputs a ___1___ takes by
adding ___2___ separated by commas between the parentheses. ___1___s by default return ___3___ if you
don't specify the value to return. ___2___ can be standard data types such as string, number, dictionary,
tuple, and ___4___ or can be more complicated such as objects and lambda functions.'''
